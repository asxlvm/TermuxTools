# TermuxTools

This is a repo for the Termux tools I make, I also share tutorials on how to fix stuff, upgrade your terminal, etc. Feel free to star it!

Current tools:
- `Convert ASCII Art
  - Converts the supplied ASCII art to an `echo` script so that you can use it in your scripts to print, can supply a color gradient, there are 9 prebuilt ones, you can also supply a padding, which is an integer that tells the script how many pixels in the terminal it should move the ASCII art by to the left. The script has no dependencies except Python, you can install Python with `pkg install python` if you haven't done that yet. \nMade by Asylum
